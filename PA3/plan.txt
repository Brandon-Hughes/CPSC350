monotonic stack is a stack whose elements appear in either 
 - monotonically increasing or decreasing order from the bottom of the stack to the top of the stack
 - duplciate values not allowed
 - Last in, First Out
 - push must ensure that values are increasng or decreasing order
 - increasing: push a value of X on the stack 
    = pop and discard all values in the stack that are larger than X
 - decreasing: push a value of X
    - pop and discard all values in the stack that are smaller than X


MonoStack: array-based stack code
 - constructor (initial size, character o)
    - if o == 'i', increasing
    - if o == 'd', decreasing
 - needs error handling

SpeakerView: 
- N Lines P doubles
 ex. 
 121.4 50.2 75.3
 90.5 80.2 60.3
 80.3 90.7 89.9
 72.1 92.6 54.4

In Column 0 there are 1 that can see. (121.4)
In Column 1 there are 4 that can see. (all)
In column 2 there are 2 that can see. (75.3, 89.9)

To build array: get line, seperate by spaces, create array's with number of indexes
                add to array each number by it's index?
ColumnNArray = 121.4, 90.5, 80.3, 72.1
    Take 121.4 if anything is higher add 1 and change to new highest number

ColumnNArray = 50.2, 80.2, 90.7, 92.6
    Take 50.2, if anything is higher add 1 and cahnge to new high number
    Take 80.2 ""
    Take 90.7 ""
    Take 92.6 ""
